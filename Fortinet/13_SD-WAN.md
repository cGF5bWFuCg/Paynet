# SD-WAN
## Underlay & Overlay Network
+ **Underlay:** Physical connections provided by Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
+ **Overlay:** Virtual links that are built on top of the physical underlay links
## Network Quality Parameters
**Congestion,** When we want to send a high volume of internal traffic through the WAN link, we will encounter congestion problems in the WAN link due to lack of bandwidth.

**Delay** 
+ **Transmission Delay,** Which is the time it takes to prepare a packet for transmission over the link.
+ **Propagation Delay,** Which is the time it takes to transfer to a node.
+ **Processing Delay,** Which is the amount of delay in processing information for transmission, and other types of delays, collectively known as Latency.

**Jitter** is the variation in packet arrival time. It is one of the key performance metrics monitors to assess the quality of network links. Along with latency and packet loss, jitter is used to evaluate the health of SD-WAN members.
